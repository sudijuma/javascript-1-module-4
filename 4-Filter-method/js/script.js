// Filter method

// If you want to filter the data displayed to a user,
// you can use the filter method.
// The filter method is used to create a new array from an existing
// array that the filter method is called on.
//


// The filter method takes a function as an argument. This function receives each item in the array as an argument.
// If the function returns true, the item is added to the new array.
